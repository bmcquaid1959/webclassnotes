    "text": "The asynchronous content for week 2 presents five examples of linear programs structured specifically to use Excel Solver.\n\nDiet Problem\nA characteristic of this particular diet problem is to use proportions of each ingredient which must sum to 1. Then, the solution minimizes total cost of one pound of the ingredients the while meeting the nutritional requirement limits.\nCrude Oil Refinery Problem\nThis is a basic blending problem wherein four crude oils are blended to create four outputs (gasoline, heating oil, jet fuel, and lubricating oil). The input-output table shows the yield from each type of crude (input) processed on unit I or II. For example, a barrel of crude #4 processed in Unit 1 produces 0.5 gallons of Gasoline, 0.1 barrels of Heating Oil, 0.2 barrels of Jet Fuel, no lube oil, and 0.2 barrels are lost in processing. Notice only Crude #4 can be produced in Unit II both reduces loss and produces Lube Oil. The goal is to maximize profit while crude oil (input) is only available in limited supply and the products (output) each have a limit on maximum demand.\nPortfolio Section Problem\nThis is a basic - single investment at time period 0 - portfolio problem with limits around average length of investment, average risk, average growth potential, and minimum cash requirements. We can use set the variables as the proportion invested in each summing to 1 OR to some arbitrary budget amount to analyze this problem.\nAgriculture Application Problem\nThis problem is somewhat like a blending problem where you have three brands of fertilizer each contributing varying amounts of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash - how many bags of each brand (whole bags only) will satisfy the chemical restrictions and minimize cost?\nMedia Selection Problem The objective is to maximize ad exposures as measured by”audience points” given a limited budget and some investment restrictions. A main concern in this model is to structure the constraints in standard form (linear combination of variables on the left hand side and only a numeric value on the right hand side of the inequalities).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMajor takeaways upon viewing these examples\n\nStructure variables, constraint formulas, and objective function\nLearn how to use relative and absolute cell references\nUsing the SUMPRODUCT formula\nLoading the model into Excel Solver\n\nYou will get better at this after completing Homework 1 and 2."

This is an introductory course in numerical methods for continuous optimization in finite dimensions. Optimization modeling techniques and numerical solution methodology will be applied to a range of important problems in operations, marketing, and finance. The optimization tools that we consider cover much of what is known as mathematical programming. We begin with linear programming and then progress through to nonlinear programming and integer programming."
